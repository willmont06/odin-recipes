# odin-recipes
This was my first project is a Mojito Recipe site 
I learned how to use Git 
How to use a remote repository
also how the command line works 
at first i had some trouble setting up 
my repository but i kept reding documentation on the 
self inflicted problems i was facing and i kept trouble shooting
until i finally understood it and got it working
